# Beacons Managed

This sample shows examples of how to detect iBeacons using foreground ranging with our new managed provider.  The managed provider removes so much code for the scan it is crazy!

This sample also makes use of Shiny.Framework which brings together ReactiveUI & Prism.  Beacon detection is an excellent space for RX to shine.
